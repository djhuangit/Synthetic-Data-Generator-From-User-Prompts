# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for Synthetic Data Generation Service, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
Since this is an API-only service with no user interface for the MVP, no separate Frontend Architecture Document is needed. This document covers the complete system architecture.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the PRD analysis, this is a greenfield project with no starter template mentioned. The project will be built from scratch using FastAPI as the foundation.

**Decision:** No starter template - manual setup required for all tooling and configuration, which aligns with the 1-hour MVP constraint and keeps the implementation focused and minimal.
