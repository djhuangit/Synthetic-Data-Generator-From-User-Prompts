# Project Brief: Synthetic Data Generation Service

## Executive Summary

A backend service that translates natural language descriptions into synthetic datasets of 1000+ rows. The service leverages GPT-4o-mini to understand user requirements and generate data schemas, then uses Python's Faker library to efficiently produce realistic synthetic data at scale. Users simply describe their data needs in plain English and receive CSV files with structured, realistic data matching their specifications. The key value proposition is eliminating the technical barrier to synthetic data generation - no coding or schema knowledge required.

## Problem Statement

Developers and data professionals frequently need realistic test data for development, testing, and demonstrations, but generating this data presents significant challenges. Current approaches require either manual creation (time-consuming and unrealistic), writing custom scripts (requires programming expertise and domain knowledge), or using complex data generation tools (steep learning curves and rigid schemas). 

The impact is substantial: teams spend hours creating test data instead of building features, testing suffers from unrealistic data sets, and demos lack compelling examples. Existing synthetic data tools either require technical expertise to define schemas programmatically or offer limited preset templates that don't match specific domain needs.

The urgency stems from the increasing need for privacy-compliant test data (avoiding production data copies) and the rapid prototyping demands of modern development cycles. Teams need synthetic data quickly, but current solutions create bottlenecks that slow down development and testing workflows.

## Proposed Solution

Our solution uses a hybrid approach that combines the natural language understanding of GPT-4o-mini with the efficiency of traditional data generation libraries. Users submit plain English descriptions of their data needs through a REST API endpoint. GPT-4o-mini processes these descriptions once to create a structured schema mapping to Faker library methods. This schema is cached for reuse, eliminating redundant API calls.

The key differentiator is the separation of concerns: AI handles only the complex task of understanding intent and mapping to appropriate data types, while proven libraries handle the actual data generation. This approach delivers the best of both worlds - intuitive natural language input without the cost and latency of generating every row through AI.

Unlike existing solutions that require technical schema definitions or offer rigid templates, our service adapts to any domain through natural language. Users can request "e-commerce customer data with purchase history" or "healthcare patient records with diagnoses" without learning schema syntax or being limited to predefined templates. The system intelligently maps domain-specific requirements to appropriate data generation patterns.

This solution succeeds where others haven't by making synthetic data generation as simple as describing what you need. The 1000+ row output capability ensures sufficient data for meaningful testing and demonstrations, while the CSV format provides universal compatibility with existing tools and workflows.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: AI/ML and Data Science Learners

**Profile:** Students, bootcamp participants, self-taught learners, and professionals transitioning into AI/ML and data science fields. Typically working on portfolio projects, coursework, or personal learning initiatives. Range from beginners taking their first data science course to intermediate learners building demonstration projects.

**Current workflows:** Currently struggle to find appropriate datasets for their projects - either using overused public datasets (Titanic, Iris), scraping data with compliance concerns, or working with toy datasets that don't reflect real-world complexity. Often spend more time searching for or cleaning data than actually learning data science concepts.

**Specific needs:** Need domain-specific datasets that match their project interests (e.g., retail analytics, healthcare predictions, financial modeling) without dealing with privacy concerns or data acquisition challenges. Require sufficient data volume (1000+ rows) to practice real data science techniques like train/test splitting, cross-validation, and pattern detection.

**Goals:** Focus on learning data science and ML concepts rather than data acquisition, build unique portfolio projects with custom datasets, and practice with realistic data that mirrors industry scenarios without compliance risks.

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Business Objectives
- Enable 100+ data science learners to generate custom datasets within first month of launch
- Reduce average time spent on data acquisition for learning projects from hours to minutes
- Support creation of unique portfolio projects that stand out from common public dataset projects

### User Success Metrics
- Learners can generate domain-specific data in under 2 minutes from description to CSV
- 80% of users successfully create datasets matching their project requirements on first attempt
- Average dataset complexity supports meaningful ML/data science exercises (multiple related fields, realistic distributions)

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Dataset Generation Speed:** Time from request to CSV delivery < 30 seconds

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

- **Natural Language Input Processing:** Accept plain English descriptions of desired datasets via REST API POST endpoint. Process descriptions like "Generate customer churn data for a telecom company" into actionable schemas
- **Schema Generation via GPT-4o-mini:** Single API call to interpret user requirements and map to Faker methods. Output structured JSON schema with field names and data types
- **Automated Data Generation:** Use Python Faker library to generate 1000+ rows based on schema. Support common data types: names, emails, dates, numbers, categories, addresses
- **CSV Export:** Generate and return CSV files ready for import into pandas, Excel, or any data science tool
- **Schema Caching:** Store generated schemas in JSON file to avoid repeated API calls for similar requests

### Out of Scope for MVP
- Multiple output formats (JSON, SQL, Parquet)
- Data relationships between multiple tables
- Custom data validation rules
- User authentication and accounts
- Web UI (API-only for MVP)
- Real-time streaming data generation
- Complex temporal patterns or time series

### MVP Success Criteria

The MVP is successful when a data science learner can send a natural language request like "Generate e-commerce transaction data with customer demographics" and receive a 1000-row CSV file with realistic, varied data within 30 seconds. The service must handle at least 5 different domain types (e-commerce, healthcare, finance, education, social media) and operate reliably within the GPT-4o-mini API constraints.

## Technical Considerations
