## Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS:** None - PRD is ready for implementation

**HIGH:**
- Data persistence strategy for schemas.json could be more detailed
- Concurrency handling for file-based cache needs clarification

**MEDIUM:**
- No monitoring/observability strategy (acceptable for MVP)
- Manual testing only may slow validation

**LOW:**
- No versioning strategy for schema evolution
- No rate limiting specified

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Scope Appropriateness:**
- Features are perfectly minimal for educational use case
- Single epic structure matches 1-hour constraint
- No unnecessary features included

**Essential Features Confirmed:**
- Natural language input ✓
- GPT-4o-mini schema generation ✓
- Schema caching ✓
- Faker data generation ✓
- CSV export ✓

**Complexity Assessment:**
- Appropriately simple architecture
- No over-engineering detected
- Clear separation of concerns

## Technical Readiness

**Clarity:** Excellent - all technical decisions documented
**Identified Risks:** Schema generation accuracy, cache concurrency
**Investigation Needs:** Optimal GPT-4o-mini prompting strategy

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:** None required - ready to proceed
2. **Post-MVP Improvements:**
   - Add integration tests
   - Implement proper logging
   - Add rate limiting
   - Consider database for schema storage

3. **Next Steps:**
   - Proceed to architecture design
   - Begin implementation with Story 1.1

## Final Decision

**READY FOR ARCHITECT** - The PRD is comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for implementation. The single-epic structure and focused scope are appropriate for the 1-hour MVP constraint.
