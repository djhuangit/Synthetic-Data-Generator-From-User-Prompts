# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

Since this is an API-only service with no user interface for the MVP, no UX expert involvement is needed at this stage. Future iterations may benefit from UX consultation if a web interface is added.

## Architect Prompt

Please review this PRD and create the technical architecture for the Synthetic Data Generation Service. Focus on:
1. Simple, implementable design that can be built in 1 hour
2. FastAPI application structure with single main.py file
3. Integration pattern for GPT-4o-mini API calls
4. File-based schema caching implementation
5. Faker library integration for data generation

The architecture should enable data science learners to generate custom synthetic datasets through natural language descriptions, delivering 1000+ row CSV files efficiently.
