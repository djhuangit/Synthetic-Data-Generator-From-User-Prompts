# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the Python project with FastAPI and all required dependencies,
**so that** I have a working foundation for building the data generation service.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Python project initialized with uv virtual environment (Python 3.12+)
2. pyproject.toml created with FastAPI, uvicorn, pandas, faker, openai, and python-dotenv dependencies
3. Basic FastAPI app structure created in main.py with health check endpoint
4. .env file configured for OpenAI API key storage
5. Server starts successfully with uvicorn and health check returns 200 OK

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Initialize Python project with uv (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create uv virtual environment with Python 3.12+
  - [x] Verify uv environment activation

- [x] Task 2: Create pyproject.toml with dependencies (AC: 2)
  - [x] Add FastAPI 0.104.1
  - [x] Add uvicorn 0.24.0
  - [x] Add pandas 2.1.3
  - [x] Add faker 19.12.0
  - [x] Add openai 1.3.7
  - [x] Add python-dotenv 1.0.0
  - [x] Install dependencies using uv

- [x] Task 3: Create basic FastAPI app structure (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create main.py with FastAPI instance
  - [x] Add health check endpoint at /health
  - [x] Configure basic FastAPI settings

- [x] Task 4: Configure environment variables (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create .env.example with OPENAI_API_KEY template
  - [x] Create .gitignore to exclude .env files
  - [x] Document environment setup in comments

- [x] Task 5: Test server startup and health check (AC: 5)
  - [x] Start server with uvicorn
  - [x] Verify /health endpoint returns 200 OK
  - [x] Test basic FastAPI functionality

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the foundation story.

### Tech Stack Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language:** Python 3.12.0 (mandatory)
- **Framework:** FastAPI 0.104.1 (PRD specified, auto documentation)
- **ASGI Server:** Uvicorn 0.24.0 (standard FastAPI deployment)
- **Dependency Management:** pyproject.toml with uv-based virtual env management

### File Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
```
synthetic-data-service/
├── pyproject.toml                 # uv dependency management and project config
├── uv.lock                        # uv lock file for reproducible builds
├── .env.example                   # Environment variable template
├── .gitignore                     # Git ignore patterns
├── main.py                        # FastAPI application entry point
```

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Type hints mandatory:** All function signatures must include parameter and return types
- **Never log API keys:** Exclude sensitive data from logs and error messages
- **Context managers:** File operations must use proper resource cleanup
- **Timeouts required:** All external API calls must have timeouts

### Environment Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/coding-standards.md]
- OpenAI API key storage via python-dotenv 1.0.0
- Secure handling required - never log API keys
- .env.example template for documentation

### FastAPI App Structure
[Source: architecture/components.md#APIController]
- Health check endpoint required for monitoring
- Entry point for all client interactions
- Automatic request/response validation
- OpenAPI documentation generation

### Testing

#### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Approach:** Manual testing for MVP, automated framework prepared for post-MVP
- **Framework:** pytest ready for post-MVP implementation
- **File Convention:** test_*.py pattern in tests/ directory
- **Location:** tests/ directory mirroring src/ structure
- **Coverage:** Not enforced for MVP (manual testing only)

#### Testing Requirements for This Story
- Manual verification of server startup
- Manual testing of /health endpoint response
- No automated tests required for MVP
