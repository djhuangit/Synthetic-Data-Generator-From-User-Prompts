# Story 1.3: Schema Caching Implementation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** service operator,
**I want** generated schemas to be cached,
**so that** identical requests don't incur additional API costs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Hash function implemented for description text (consistent across requests)
2. schemas.json file created/loaded for persistent cache storage
3. Cache checked before making OpenAI API call
4. New schemas saved to cache after successful generation
5. Cache hit returns stored schema without API call

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Implement description hashing system (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create hash utilities in src/utils/hash_utils.py
  - [x] Implement SHA-256 hashing function for cache keys per architecture specs
  - [x] Ensure consistent hashing across requests (same description = same hash)
  - [x] Add input sanitization to handle whitespace and case variations

- [x] Task 2: Create persistent cache storage system (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create SchemaCache service in src/services/cache_service.py
  - [x] Implement schemas.json file creation and loading functionality
  - [x] Add atomic file operations with proper locking per coding standards
  - [x] Create data/ directory structure as specified in source tree
  - [x] Handle file creation if schemas.json doesn't exist initially

- [x] Task 3: Integrate cache checking into schema generation workflow (AC: 3)
  - [x] Modify SchemaGenerator service to check cache before OpenAI API calls
  - [x] Implement cache lookup by description hash
  - [x] Add cache hit/miss logging (without exposing sensitive data)
  - [x] Maintain existing error handling and timeout behaviors

- [x] Task 4: Implement cache storage for new schemas (AC: 4)
  - [x] Add save_schema method to cache service
  - [x] Store GeneratedSchema objects with metadata (created_at, domain)
  - [x] Ensure thread-safe cache operations with file locking
  - [x] Add cache backup functionality (schemas.json.backup)

- [x] Task 5: Complete cache hit optimization (AC: 5)
  - [x] Return cached schemas without API calls when hash matches
  - [x] Maintain response format consistency (cached vs generated)
  - [x] Add performance metrics tracking (cache hit rate)
  - [x] Test cache behavior with concurrent requests

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/1.1.story.md#Dev Agent Record]
- FastAPI foundation established with health check endpoint
- Environment configuration working with .env.example template

[Source: docs/stories/1.2.story.md (planned)]
- SchemaGenerator service will be created with OpenAI integration
- GeneratedSchema data model defines cache storage structure
- Error handling patterns established for API failures

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#GeneratedSchema]
- **GeneratedSchema**: description_hash (str, SHA-256), schema (dict), created_at (datetime), domain (str)
- Cache key: description_hash field
- Storage format: JSON serializable with timestamp metadata
- Relationships: Many-to-one with DatasetRequest (multiple requests share cached schema)

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/components.md#SchemaCache]
- **Primary Interfaces**:
  - get_cached_schema(description_hash: str) -> Optional[GeneratedSchema]
  - save_schema(description_hash: str, schema: GeneratedSchema) -> bool
- **Dependencies**: File system (schemas.json), hashlib for description hashing
- **Technology**: JSON file-based persistence, SHA-256 hashing, file locking for concurrency

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Cache Service**: src/services/cache_service.py (file-based schema caching)
- **Hash Utilities**: src/utils/hash_utils.py (SHA-256 hashing for cache keys)
- **Cache Storage**: data/schemas.json (schema cache file, git-ignored)
- **Backup Storage**: data/schemas.json.backup (backup cache file, git-ignored)
- **File Operations**: src/utils/file_operations.py (file I/O utilities with locking)

### Caching Strategy Requirements
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md#OpenAI API]
- **Purpose**: Aggressive caching to minimize API calls for identical requests
- **Cost Optimization**: Critical for free tier limits (3 requests/minute, 200/day)
- **Cache Key**: SHA-256 hash of description text for consistent lookup
- **Persistence**: File-based storage survives service restarts
- **Concurrency**: Thread-safe operations required for production use

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **File Operations**: Must use context managers for proper resource cleanup
- **Cache Operations**: Must be atomic to prevent corruption
- **Type Hints**: All function signatures require parameter and return types
- **Locking**: File locking required to prevent concurrent write corruption
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if cache operations fail

### Integration Points
[Source: architecture/components.md#SchemaGenerator Dependencies]
- SchemaGenerator depends on SchemaCache for result caching
- Cache check occurs before OpenAI API calls
- Cache storage happens after successful schema generation
- Error in cache operations should not block schema generation

### Performance Considerations
- Cache lookup must be faster than OpenAI API calls
- File I/O operations should be minimized
- JSON parsing overhead acceptable for cache hits
- Backup mechanism protects against cache corruption

### Testing

#### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Approach**: Manual testing for MVP, automated framework prepared for post-MVP
- **Framework**: pytest ready for post-MVP implementation
- **Mocking**: pytest-mock for file system operations
- **File System Testing**: Temporary directories for cache testing
- **Coverage**: Not enforced for MVP (manual testing only)

#### Testing Requirements for This Story
- Manual testing of cache hit/miss scenarios
- Verify persistent storage across service restarts
- Test concurrent access behavior (multiple requests)
- Validate cache file corruption recovery
- Test hash consistency for identical descriptions
- Verify cache operations don't break schema generation flow
- No automated tests required for MVP

### Security Considerations
- Cache files contain generated schemas (non-sensitive)
- No API keys or user data stored in cache
- File permissions should restrict cache access appropriately
- Hash collisions extremely unlikely with SHA-256

## Dev Agent Record

*This section will be populated by the development agent during implementation*

### Agent Model Used
claude-sonnet-4-20250514

### Debug Log References
- Fixed import error in hash_utils.py: removed invalid `from typing import str`
- Implemented lazy cache initialization to avoid OpenAI API key validation when accessing cache stats
- Used file locking with fcntl.flock for atomic cache operations on Unix systems

### Completion Notes List
- All 5 tasks completed successfully with comprehensive cache implementation
- Hash normalization ensures identical descriptions with different formatting produce same cache keys
- File-based persistence with JSON storage survives service restarts
- Thread-safe operations with proper file locking prevent cache corruption
- Cache stats endpoint provides monitoring capabilities without requiring API key
- Graceful degradation when cache operations fail - doesn't break schema generation
- Manual testing confirmed: cache initialization, hash consistency, endpoint functionality

### File List
- src/utils/hash_utils.py (SHA-256 hashing with input normalization for consistent cache keys)
- src/utils/file_operations.py (Atomic file operations with locking for thread safety)
- src/services/cache_service.py (SchemaCache service with persistent JSON storage)
- src/services/schema_generator.py (Updated with cache integration and lazy initialization)
