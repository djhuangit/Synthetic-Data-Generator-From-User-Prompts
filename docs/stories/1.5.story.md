## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/1.1.story.md#Dev Agent Record]
- FastAPI foundation established with Pandas 2.1.3 dependency
- Auto-generated API documentation accessible at /docs

[Source: docs/stories/1.2.story.md (planned)]
- POST /generate endpoint accepts DatasetRequest with description
- Error handling patterns established with ErrorResponse model

[Source: docs/stories/1.3.story.md (planned)]
- Schema caching optimizes performance by avoiding repeated API calls

[Source: docs/stories/1.4.story.md (planned)]
- DataGenerator produces SyntheticDataset with data, row_count, field_names, generation_time

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **SyntheticDataset**: 
  - data (List[Dict]) - Generated records to convert to CSV
  - row_count (int) - Number of rows for response headers
  - field_names (List[str]) - Column headers for DataFrame
  - generation_time (float) - Performance tracking data
- **DatasetResponse**:
  - csv_content (str) - Generated CSV data as string
  - filename (str) - Suggested filename from description
  - row_count (int) - Rows in dataset for headers
  - content_type (str) - MIME type ("text/csv")

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/components.md#CSVExporter]
- **Primary Interfaces**:
  - export_to_csv(dataset: SyntheticDataset) -> DatasetResponse
  - generate_filename(description: str) -> str
- **Dependencies**: Pandas library for DataFrame operations
- **Technology**: Pandas 2.1.3, HTTP response header management, string utilities

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **CSV Exporter**: src/services/csv_exporter.py (CSV export functionality)
- **Service Integration**: CSVExporter called by APIController as final pipeline step
- **Response Format**: DatasetResponse returned to client as CSV download

### API Response Specifications
[Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md#/generate Response 200]
- **Content-Type**: text/csv
- **Content-Disposition**: attachment; filename="descriptive_name.csv"
- **Custom Headers**:
  - X-Row-Count: Number of rows in dataset
  - X-Generation-Time: Generation time in seconds
- **Response Body**: CSV file with headers, compatible with pandas/Excel

### CSV Format Requirements
Based on data science tool compatibility:
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 for international character support
- **Delimiter**: Comma (standard CSV)
- **Headers**: First row contains column names from schema
- **Quoting**: Appropriate escaping for special characters
- **Line Endings**: Compatible with cross-platform tools

### Filename Generation Strategy
- **Source**: Natural language description from DatasetRequest
- **Sanitization**: Remove/replace invalid filesystem characters
- **Format**: descriptive_name_timestamp.csv or similar
- **Examples**:
  - "e-commerce product data" -> "ecommerce_product_data.csv"
  - "healthcare patient records" -> "healthcare_patient_records.csv"
- **Length**: Keep reasonable length for filesystem compatibility

### Performance Requirements
[Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md#Performance Target]
- **Total Response Time**: <30 seconds for complete request-to-CSV
- **CSV Generation**: Should be minimal overhead compared to data generation
- **Memory Efficiency**: Handle up to 10,000 rows in memory
- **Streaming**: Not required for MVP, in-memory generation acceptable

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Type Hints**: All function signatures must include parameter and return types
- **Resource Management**: Proper memory management for large datasets
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of DataFrame conversion errors
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 encoding for international compatibility

### Integration Points
[Source: architecture/components.md Data Flow]
- **Input**: SyntheticDataset from DataGenerator
- **Output**: HTTP response with CSV content and headers
- **API Coordination**: APIController orchestrates complete pipeline
- **Error Integration**: Must work with existing ErrorResponse patterns

### Testing

#### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Approach**: Manual testing for MVP, automated framework prepared for post-MVP
- **Framework**: pytest ready for post-MVP implementation
- **Coverage**: Not enforced for MVP (manual testing only)
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete user workflows from request to CSV response

#### Testing Requirements for This Story
- Manual testing of CSV generation from various SyntheticDataset formats
- Verify CSV compatibility with pandas.read_csv() and Excel
- Test filename generation with various description types
- Validate HTTP response headers and content-type
- Test complete pipeline performance within 30-second target
- Verify CSV encoding and special character handling
- Test error scenarios (malformed data, large datasets)
- No automated tests required for MVP

#### CSV Compatibility Testing
- **Pandas**: Ensure generated CSV loads correctly with pd.read_csv()
- **Excel**: Test opening CSV files in Microsoft Excel
- **Google Sheets**: Verify import functionality
- **Other Tools**: Test with common data science applications

### Error Handling Scenarios
- DataFrame conversion failures from malformed SyntheticDataset
- Pandas to_csv() errors with special data types
- Large dataset memory constraints during CSV generation
- Invalid characters in filename generation
- HTTP response generation failures

### Data Science Tool Integration
- **Column Headers**: Clear, descriptive names from schema
- **Data Types**: Appropriate formatting for numeric vs text data
- **Missing Values**: Handle null/empty values appropriately
- **Consistency**: Ensure CSV structure matches original schema intent
